The app enables interactive exploration of ICU patient data—including vitals, labs, and clinical timelines—by integrating multiple data sources and visualizing patient-level trajectories.\nExploratory Analysis with MIMIC-IV Clinical Data\nConducted observational cohort studies using R and SQL-based tools (Arrow, DuckDB, BigQuery). Focused on ICU patient demographics, lab/vital signs, and longitudinal event data using ggplot2, dplyr, and lubridate.\nPredictive Modeling of Diabetes\nBuilt statistical models in R to assess which health indicators are most predictive of diabetes diagnoses, and evaluated feature relationships through correlation analysis.\nCivic Engagement Survey at UCLA\nAnalyzed survey data using linear mixed effects models, clustering, and text mining to uncover behavioral trends across different UCLA student populations.\nAssociations Between Music and Mental Health\nConducted research under the mentorship of Dr. Tsiang to explore the relationship between music listening habits and mental health outcomes. Developed a methodology grounded in prior literature to identify meaningful statistical associations."

## About Me

Hi! I'm Kiana Mohammadinik, a graduate student pursuing my M.S. in Biostatistics at UCLA. I hold a B.S. in Statistics and Data Science with a Minor in History, also from UCLA. I am passionate about using data to drive insights and improve decision-making in the healthcare sector.

My academic and research interests lie at the intersection of data science, statistical modeling, and healthcare analytics. I enjoy exploring complex datasets and building tools that improve the accessibility and impact of research, particularly in health contexts.

## Research & Projects

- **Interactive ICU Data Explorer (Shiny App)**  
  Designed a dynamic R Shiny application that connects to the MIMIC-IV clinical database via Google BigQuery. The app enables interactive exploration of ICU patient data—including vitals, labs, and clinical timelines—by integrating multiple data sources and visualizing patient-level trajectories.

- **Exploratory Analysis with MIMIC-IV Clinical Data**  
  Conducted observational cohort studies using R and SQL-based tools (Arrow, DuckDB, BigQuery). Focused on ICU patient demographics, lab/vital signs, and longitudinal event data using ggplot2, dplyr, and lubridate.

- **Predictive Modeling of Diabetes**  
  Built statistical models in R to assess which health indicators are most predictive of diabetes diagnoses, and evaluated feature relationships through correlation analysis.

- **Civic Engagement Survey at UCLA**  
  Analyzed survey data using linear mixed effects models, clustering, and text mining to uncover behavioral trends across different UCLA student populations.

- **Associations Between Music and Mental Health**  
  Conducted research under the mentorship of Dr. Tsiang to explore the relationship between music listening habits and mental health outcomes. Developed a methodology grounded in prior literature to identify meaningful statistical associations.

## Experience

### Undergraduate Math Tutor — Santa Monica College (Feb. 2020 – Jun. 2022)  
Supported students in Calculus through one-on-one and group tutoring sessions. Collaborated with professors to track progress and led classes in their absence. Developed communication skills and a passion for making complex material accessible.
